Write your first Vagrantfile using the latest stable version of the distribution
of your choice as your operating system. It is STRONGLY advised to allow only the
bare minimum in terms of resources: 1 CPU, 512 MB of RAM (or 1024). The machines
must be run using Vagrant.

You now understand the basics of K3s. Time to go further! To complete this part, you
will need only one virtual machine with the distribution of your choice (latest
stable version) and K3s in server mode installed.
You will set up 3 web applications of your choice that will run in your K3s instance.
You will have to be able to access them depending on the HOST used when making a
request to the IP address 192.168.56.110. The name of this machine will be your login
followed by S (e.g., wilS if your login is wil).

You now master a minimalist version of K3S! Time to set up everything you have just
learnt (and much more!) but without Vagrant this time. To begin, install K3D on your
virtual machine.
You will need Docker for K3d to work, and probably some other
softwares too. Thus, you have to write a script to install every
necessary packages and tools during your defense.
First of all, you must understand the difference between K3S and K3D.
Once your configuration works as expected, you can start to create your first continuous integration!
